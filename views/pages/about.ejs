              We created Zave as a place to save the web in private or with the
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe a big benefit of Zave is that you can create reading
              lists that allows you to share them with friends, family or your
              social media following.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're passionate about sharing great content! The web is a
              fantastic place where we all regularly find great resouces like
              blog posts, news articles, videos and more. We wanted to allow
              people to create a list of web pages that they can keep safe for
              their personal reference, or to share with the world.

            We are committed to improving Zave based on our users feedback. We
            have plans to create team accounts that will allow a group of people
            to share links or resources with anyone they invite to their team
            account.
